								Youhe bread, founded in 2016, is a new high-end healthy toasted bread chain 
								brand launched by St. Andrew in Wuhan. As a new era baking brand, Youhe bread
								is well aware of the health needs of contemporary consumers. As the English
								name uhealth conveys, Youhe bread has never given up its insistence on natural 
								raw materials and crafts. Bake the bread with excellent export feeling, which 
								is delicious and healthy. Adhere to the characteristics of low sugar and low oil 
								to meet every customer's critical taste buds. In the era of fast food, we insist 
								on making every bread slowly and carefully, hoping to present the most quality 
								works to you. Constantly pursuing perfection and refinement, what we care about 
								is not the opinions of others, but the sense of self transcendence, and this 
								spirit is exactly the original intention of our Yuhe bread.</p>
